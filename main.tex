 	\chapter*{Abstract}
 	This work builds upon Professor S.Aguzzoli \& P.Codara's paper \cite{towards}. \newline
 	Its primary aim is to explore the topos semantics of a particular fragment of super-intuitionistic and fuzzy logic namely \emph{three-valued Gödel-Dummett Logic} $\mathcal{G}_3$. 
 	The dual-algebraic semantics of $\mathcal{G}_3$ is given by the sub-category of \emph{finite forests} of height at most two $\mathbb{FF}_2$, a.k.a. \emph{bushes}. Building upon the topos-semantics of \emph{bushes} at the propositional layer, we arrive through a new path at first-order topos semantics for $\mathcal{G}_3$.\newline
 In chapter 1 we present this logic after a more general introduction of intuitionistic logic and its principal semantics given by Heyting algebras and Kripke frames, which will come up later on. \newline
 In chapter 2 we give a detailed account of \emph{finite forests} and in particular the sub-category of \emph{bushes}, which forms a topos and is dually equivalent to finite three-valued Gödel algebras.
Continuing where \cite{towards} left off, we provide a novel counterexample to show why $\mathbb{FF}_k$, i.e., \emph{finite forests} of height at most $k$ with $k$ greater than two, fails to be a topos. An original Python code is also used to aid in these constructions. \newline
 In chapter 3, following the development outlined in \cite{goldblatt} and giving whenever necessary some generalities of topos semantics, we examine the propositional layer of the topos semantics given by \emph{bushes} and propose some results regarding its internal and external logics. \newline
 In chapter 4 we follow up from chapter 3 and move on to first order logic. We start by giving an account by \cite{goldblatt} of first order topos models and make some considerations on predicates and modeling three-valued Gödel-Dummett logic before taking an alternative type-theoretic approach to quantifiers due to \cite{lambekscott} and applying it to our topos of bushes. Conclusive remarks are made on this application and the recovery of first order Gödel-Dummett logic. \newline   
 In chapter 5,  we compare our findings with alternative topos semantics for $\mathcal{G}_3$ given by \emph{variable sets} and \emph{sheaves} and make some new remarks on the matter. \newline
 The conclusion is a short summary of what has been achieved throughout this work, its justification and a few comments on further areas of research. \newline\newline
